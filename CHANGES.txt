  teardown of the Startup layer in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- Allow doctest suites from `zope.testing` to work with `plone.testing.layer.layered`.

  [nouri]

- Changed documentation to advertise the `coverage` library for running
  coverage tests instead of the built-in `zope.testing` support. This also
  avoids using `z3c.coverage`. The coverage tests now run at the same speed
  as a normal test run, making it more likely to get executed frequently.
  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

- Fix some user id vs name confusion.
  [rossp]

- Set the security implementation to "Python" for easier debugging during
  the z2.STARTUP layer.
