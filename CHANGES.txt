Changelog
=========

4.0.4 (2012-08-04)
------------------

- Fixed the cache reset code. In some situations the function does not
  have any defaults, so we shouldn't try to clear out the app
  reference.
  [malthe]

4.0.3 (2011-11-24)
------------------

- Fixed class names in documentation to match code.
  [icemac]

4.0.2 (2011-08-31)
------------------

- The defaults of the ``ZPublisher.Publish.get_module_info`` function cache
  a reference to the app, so make sure that gets reset when tearing down the
  app. This fixes a problem where the testbrowser in the second functional
  layer to be set up accessed the database from the first functional layer.
  [davisagli]

  [optilude]


4.0a4 - 2011-01-11
------------------

- Make sure ZCML doesn't load during App startup in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]


4.0a3 - 2010-12-14
------------------

- Ignore the `testinghome` configuration setting if present.
  [stefan]

- Use the new API for getting the packages_to_initialize list in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- De-duplicate _register_monkies and _meta_type_regs in the correct module on
  teardown of the Startup layer in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- Allow doctest suites from `zope.testing` to work with `plone.testing.layer.layered`.
  Previously, only doctest suites from the stdlib would see the `layer` global.
  [nouri]

- Changed documentation to advertise the `coverage` library for running
  coverage tests instead of the built-in `zope.testing` support. This also
  avoids using `z3c.coverage`. The coverage tests now run at the same speed
  as a normal test run, making it more likely to get executed frequently.
  [hannosch]

- Correct license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]

- Fix some user id vs name confusion.
  [rossp]

- Add the option to specify ZServer host and port through environment
  variables - ZSERVER_HOST and ZSERVER_PORT).

  In particular fixes the use of the ``zope2.Public`` permission.
  [optilude]

- Set the security implementation to "Python" for easier debugging during
  the z2.STARTUP layer.
  [optilude]

- Initialize Five in the z2.Startup layer, pushing a Zope2VocabularyRegistry on
  layer set-up and restoring the previous one upon tear-down.
