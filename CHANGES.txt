Changelog
=========

4.0a5 (2011-03-02)
------------------

- Handle test failures due to userFolderAddUser returning the user object in
  newer versions of Zope.
  [esteele]
  
- Add ``setUpZcmlFiles`` and ``tearDownZcmlFiles`` helpers to enable loading 
  of ZCML files without too much boilerplate.
  [gotcha]

- Add some logging.
  [gotcha]

- Add the ``[security]`` extra, to provide tear-down of security checkers.
  [optilude]

- Let the ``IntegrationTesting`` and ``FunctionalTesting`` lifecycle layers
  set up request ``PARENTS`` and, if present, wire up
  ``zope.globalrequest``.
  [optilude]

- Make the test browser support IStreamIterators
  [optilue]

4.0a4 (2011-01-11)
------------------

- Make sure ZCML doesn't load during App startup in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

4.0a3 (2010-12-14)
------------------

- Ignore the `testinghome` configuration setting if present.
  [stefan]

- Use the new API for getting the packages_to_initialize list in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- De-duplicate _register_monkies and _meta_type_regs in the correct module on
  teardown of the Startup layer in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- Allow doctest suites from `zope.testing` to work with
  `plone.testing.layer.layered`.  Previously, only doctest suites from
  the stdlib would see the `layer` global.
  [nouri]

- Changed documentation to advertise the `coverage` library for running
  coverage tests instead of the built-in `zope.testing` support. This also
  avoids using `z3c.coverage`. The coverage tests now run at the same speed
  as a normal test run, making it more likely to get executed frequently.
  [hannosch]

- Correct license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]

- Fix some user id vs name confusion.
  [rossp]

- Add the option to specify ZServer host and port through environment
  variables (ZSERVER_HOST and ZSERVER_PORT).
  [esteele]

1.0a2 - 2010-09-05
------------------

- Fix a problem that would cause ``<meta:redefinePermission />`` to break.
  In particular fixes the use of the ``zope2.Public`` permission.
  [optilude]

- Set the security implementation to "Python" for easier debugging during
  the z2.STARTUP layer.
  [optilude]

- Initialize Five in the z2.Startup layer, pushing a
  Zope2VocabularyRegistry on layer set-up and restoring the previous
  one upon tear-down.
  [dukebody]

1.0a1 - 2010-08-01
------------------

- Initial release
