Changelog
=========

3.0a2 (2011-05-24)
------------------

- The defaults of the ``ZPublisher.Publish.get_module_info`` function cache
  a reference to the app, so make sure that gets reset when tearing down the
  app. This fixes a problem where the testbrowser in the second functional
  layer to be set up accessed the database from the first functional layer.
  [davisagli]

- Moved readme file containing tests into the package, so tests can be run from
  released source distributions. Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11821.
  [hannosch]

- Relicense under BSD license.
  See http://plone.org/foundation/materials/foundation-resolutions/plone-framework-components-relicensing-policy
  [davisagli]

- Backport to Zope 2.10 where we don't have zope.site package and doing
  ZCA hooks in zope.app.component.
  [piv]

- Add ``ZCMLSandbox`` layer to load a ZCML file.
  [gotcha]

- Add some logging.
  [gotcha]

- Add the ``[security]`` extra, to provide tear-down of security checkers.
  [optilude]

- Let the ``IntegrationTesting`` and ``FunctionalTesting`` lifecycle layers
  set up request ``PARENTS`` and, if present, wire up
  ``zope.globalrequest``.
  [optilude]

- Make the test browser support IStreamIterators

3.0a1 (2010-12-14)
------------------

- Backport to Zope 2.10
  [gotcha, jfroche]

- Ignore the `testinghome` configuration setting if present.
  [stefan]

- Use the new API for getting the packages_to_initialize list in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- De-duplicate _register_monkies and _meta_type_regs in the correct module on
  teardown of the Startup layer in Zope 2.13.
  [davisagli]

- Allow doctest suites from `zope.testing` to work with
  `plone.testing.layer.layered`.  Previously, only doctest suites from
  the stdlib would see the `layer` global.
  [nouri]

- Changed documentation to advertise the `coverage` library for running
  coverage tests instead of the built-in `zope.testing` support. This also
  avoids using `z3c.coverage`. The coverage tests now run at the same speed
  as a normal test run, making it more likely to get executed frequently.
  [hannosch]

- Correct license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]

- Fix some user id vs name confusion.
  [rossp]

- Add the option to specify ZServer host and port through environment
  variables (ZSERVER_HOST and ZSERVER_PORT).
  [esteele]

1.0a2 - 2010-09-05
------------------

- Fix a problem that would cause ``<meta:redefinePermission />`` to break.
  In particular fixes the use of the ``zope2.Public`` permission.
  [optilude]

- Set the security implementation to "Python" for easier debugging during
  the z2.STARTUP layer.
  [optilude]

- Initialize Five in the z2.Startup layer, pushing a
  Zope2VocabularyRegistry on layer set-up and restoring the previous
  one upon tear-down.
  [dukebody]

1.0a1 - 2010-08-01
------------------
